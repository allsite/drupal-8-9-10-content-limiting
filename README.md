Content Limiting
======================
Content Limiting provides options for limiting the scope of content for content types. 
After enabling limiting the content type will be restricted to retain a specific amount 
of content pieces. When a content piece is added that exceeds the limit, Content Limiter 
will delete as many items needed to enforce the set limit.
